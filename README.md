# RBAC + Tenant Isolation + Audit Logs (Backend Foundation)

## Objective
This module provides the security foundation for the system:
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for Admin, Reviewer, Requester, and Vendor.
- **Tenant Isolation**: All data access scoped by `org_id` to prevent cross-org data leaks.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks critical actions for audit-ready history.
